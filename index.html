    <br />

    THIS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) dated _______, 20_____
    (the “Effective Date”) is made between _______________ (the “Company”), and
    _______________ (the “Freelancer”), with an office at
    ____________________________, for the purpose of setting forth the exclusive
    terms and conditions by which Company desires to acquire Freelancer’s
    services.

    <br /><br />

    In consideration of the mutual obligations specified in this Agreement, the
    parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree to the following:

    <br /><br />

    <div class="clause">
      <b>1. Services.</b> Company retains Freelancer, and Freelancer agrees to
      perform for Company, certain services set forth in <u>Exhibit A</u> to
      this Agreement (the “Services”).
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <b>2. Consideration / Compensation:</b>

      (a) In exchange for the full, prompt, and satisfactory performance of all
      Services to be rendered to Company (as determined by the Company), Company
      shall provide Freelancer, as full and complete compensation the sum of
      $________ to be paid at the completion of the Services. (b) Freelancer is
      not entitled to receive any other compensation or any benefits from
      Company. Except as otherwise required by law, Company shall not withhold
      any sums or payments made to Freelancer for social security or other
      federal, state, or local tax liabilities or contributions, and all
      withholdings, liabilities, and contributions shall be solely Freelancer’s
      responsibility. Freelancer further understands and agrees that the
      Services are not covered under the unemployment compensation laws and are
      not intended to be covered by workers’ compensation laws.
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <b>3. Nondisclosure:</b>

      (a) Freelancer understands that, in connection with its engagement with
      Company, it may receive, produce, or otherwise be exposed to Company’s
      trade secrets, business, proprietary and/or technical information,
      including, without limitation, information concerning customer lists,
      customer support strategies, employees, research and development,
      financial information (including sales, costs, profits, and pricing
      methods), manufacturing, marketing, proprietary software, hardware,
      firmware, and related documentation, inventions (whether patentable or
      not), know-how, show-how, and other information considered to be
      confidential by Company, and all derivatives, improvements and
      enhancements to any of the above (including those derivatives,
      improvements and enhancements that were created or developed by Freelancer
      under this Agreement), in addition to all information Company receives
      from others under an obligation of confidentiality (individually and
      collectively “Confidential Information”). (b) Freelancer acknowledges that
      the Confidential Information is the Company’s sole, exclusive and
      extremely valuable property. Accordingly, Freelancer agrees to segregate
      all Confidential Information from information of other companies and
      agrees not to reproduce any Confidential Information without Company’s
      prior written consent, not to use the Confidential Information except in
      the performance of this Agreement, and not to divulge all or any part of
      the Confidential Information in any form to any third party, either during
      or after the term of this Agreement, except to Company employees and
      Freelancer Employees who need to know such Confidential Information in
      order to perform the Services. Freelancer shall require such Freelancer
      Employees to execute a non-disclosure agreement satisfactory to the
      Company before such Freelancer Employee is exposed to any Confidential
      Information. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any
      reason, Freelancer agrees to cease using and to return to Company all
      whole and partial copies and derivatives of the Confidential Information,
      whether in Freelancer’s possession or under Freelancer’s direct or
      indirect control, including any computer access nodes and/or codes, and to
      arrange for the return of such materials by all Freelancer Employees. (c)
      Freelancer shall not disclose or otherwise make available to Company in
      any manner any confidential and proprietary information received by
      Freelancer from third parties. Freelancer warrants that its performance of
      all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement
      entered into by Freelancer with any other party.
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <b>4. Indemnification / Release:</b>

      (a) Freelancer agrees to take all necessary precautions to prevent injury
      to any persons or damage to property during the term of this Agreement,
      and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company, its officers,
      directors, shareholders, employees, representatives and/or agents from any
      claim, liability, loss, cost, damage, judgment, settlement or expense
      (including attorney’s fees) resulting from or arising in any way out of
      injury (including death) to any person or damage to property arising in
      any way out of any act, error, omission or negligence on the part of
      Freelancer or any Freelancer Employee in the performance or failure to
      fulfill any Services or obligations under this Agreement. 5. Insurance and
      Other Requirements: (a) Freelancer warrants that it will obtain and keep
      in full force and effect at all times hereunder workers’ compensation,
      general liability and errors and omissions or professional liability
      insurance covering all of its Services. Company shall be listed as an
      additional named insured and/or as an additional loss-payee under such
      policies. (b) Freelancer shall provide to the Company copies of all
      policies required to be maintained, and a Certificate of Insurance
      indicating said coverage shall be provided to Company upon request. (c)
      Freelancer also warrants and represents that it has properly classified
      all of its workers, has and will maintain all required licenses and
      certifications. 6. Termination: This Agreement shall be effective on the
      date hereof and shall continue until terminated by either party upon 14
      business days written notice.
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <b>7. Independent Contractor:</b>

      (a) Company and Freelancer expressly agree and understand that Freelancer
      is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall be
      construed in any way or manner, to create between them a relationship of
      employer and employee, principal and agent, partners or any other
      relationship other than that of independent parties contracting with each
      other solely for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the
      Agreement. Accordingly, Freelancer acknowledges that Freelancer and
      Freelancer’s Employees are not eligible for any Company benefits,
      including, but not limited to, health insurance, retirement plans or stock
      option plans. Freelancer is not the agent of Company and is not authorized
      and shall not have the power or authority to bind Company or incur any
      liability or obligation, or act on behalf of Company. At no time shall
      Freelancer represent that it is an agent of the Company, or that any of
      the views, advice, statements and/or information that may be provided
      while performing the Services are those of the Company. (b) Freelancer is
      solely responsible for directing and controlling the performance of the
      Services, including the time, place and manner in which the Services are
      performed. Freelancer shall use its best efforts, energy and skill in its
      own name and in such manner as it sees fit.
    </div>

    <div class="clause">
      <b>8. General:</b>

      (a) This Agreement does not create an obligation on Company to continue to
      retain Freelancer beyond this Agreement’s termination. This Agreement may
      not be changed unless mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties. (b)
      Freelancer hereby agrees that any breach of Section 3 by Freelancer will
      cause irreparable harm to Company and that in the event of such breach or
      threatened breach, Company shall have, in addition to any and all remedies
      of law and those remedies stated in this Agreement, the right to an
      injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent the
      violation of Freelancer’s obligations hereunder. (c) Freelancer hereby
      agrees that each provision herein shall be treated as a separate and
      independent clause, and the unenforceability of any one clause shall in no
      way impair the enforceability of any of the other clauses herein. (d) This
      Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
      respect to the transactions contemplated herein. The language of all parts
      of this Agreement will in all cases be construed as a whole in accordance
      with its fair meaning and not for or against either party. (e) All notices
      provided for in this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be
      effective when either served by hand delivery, electronic facsimile
      transmission, express overnight courier service, or by registered or
      certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the parties at
      their respective addresses as set forth at the beginning of this
      Agreement, or to such other address or addresses as either party may later
